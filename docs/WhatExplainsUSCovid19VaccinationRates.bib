  abstract = {Many social scientists believe that dumping long lists of explanatory variables into linear regression, probit, logit, and other statistical equations will successfully ``control'' for the effects of auxiliary factors. Encouraged by convenient software and ever more powerful computing, researchers also believe that this conventional approach gives the true explanatory variables the best chance to emerge. The present paper argues that these beliefs are false, and that without intensive data analysis, linear regression models are likely to be inaccurate. Instead, a quite different and less mechanical research methodology is needed, one that integrates contemporary powerful statistical methods with deep substantive knowledge and classic data\textemdash analytic techniques of creative engagement with the data.},

For example, each 1\% increase between 40\%-50\% coverage can prevent 1.5million cases, 56,240 hospitalizations, 6,660 deaths, gain 77,590 QALYs, save \$602.8 million in direct medical costs and \$1.3 billion in productivity losses .

  abstract = {Cross-validation is a widely-used technique to estimate prediction error, but its behavior is complex and not fully understood. Ideally, one would like to think that cross-validation estimates the prediction error for the model at hand, fit to the training data. We prove that this is not the case for the linear model fit by ordinary least squares; rather it estimates the average prediction error of models fit on other unseen training sets drawn from the same population. We further show that this phenomenon occurs for most popular estimates of prediction error, including data splitting, bootstrapping, and Mallow's Cp. Next, the standard confidence intervals for prediction error derived from cross-validation may have coverage far below the desired level. Because each data point is used for both training and testing, there are correlations among the measured accuracies for each fold, and so the usual estimate of variance is too small. We introduce a nested cross-validation scheme to estimate this variance more accurately, and show empirically that this modification leads to intervals with approximately correct coverage in many examples where traditional cross-validation intervals fail. Lastly, our analysis also shows that when producing confidence intervals for prediction accuracy with simple data splitting, one should not re-fit the model on the combined data, since this invalidates the confidence intervals.},

Using generalized linear models with binomial distributions and log links, we found that a 10-point increase in the CCVI index, socioeconomic vulnerability, housing type and composition, and epidemiological factors were associated with at least a 1.0 percentage point decline in county-level vaccination.

Studying factors that encourage community acceptance of these vaccines is needed to prevent proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 variants, to safely relax local restrictions, and to return to pre-pandemic living conditions. To our knowledge, United States (US) county-level disparities in vaccination are yet to be investigated. Our data span February - May 2021 across 3138 US counties. We consider percentage of residents with at least one dose of an authorized COVID vaccine as the outcome. Spatio-temporal models were used to determine associations of vaccination rates with time-fixed and time-varying covariates. Spatial variability was modelled via Conditional Auto-regressive models; county trajectories over time were specified using random slopes. Greater vaccination rates occur in counties with older residents, high educational attainment, and high proportion of minority residents. Vaccination rates change with COVID risk metrics, suggesting continued slowing of vaccine uptake due to decreasing incidence and infection rates. County effects reveal strong regional patterns in average vaccination rates and trajectories. Although local herd immunity can be expected in August 2021 for counties with typical uptake rates, these counties are clustered in relatively few areas of the country.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background Incomplete immunisation coverage causes preventable illness and death in both developing and developed countries. Identification of factors that might modulate coverage could inform effective immunisation programmes and policies. We constructed a performance indicator that could quantitatively approximate measures of the susceptibility of immunisation programmes to coverage losses, with an aim to identify correlations between trends in vaccine coverage and socioeconomic factors. Methods We undertook a data-driven time-series analysis to examine trends in coverage of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccination across 190 countries over the past 30 years. We grouped countries into six world regions according to WHO classifications. We used Gaussian process regression to forecast future coverage rates and provide a vaccine performance index: a summary measure of the strength of immunisation coverage in a country. Findings Overall vaccine coverage increased in all six world regions between 1980 and 2010, with variation in volatility and trends. Our vaccine performance index identified that 53 countries had more than a 50\% chance of missing the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) target of 90\% worldwide coverage with three doses of DTP (DTP3) by 2015. These countries were mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, but Austria and Ukraine also featured. Factors associated with DTP3 immunisation coverage varied by world region: personal income (Spearman's {$\rho$}=0{$\cdot$}66, p=0{$\cdot$}0011) and government health spending (0{$\cdot$}66, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) were informative of immunisation coverage in the Eastern Mediterranean between 1980 and 2010, whereas primary school completion was informative of coverage in Africa (0{$\cdot$}56, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) over the same period. The proportion of births attended by skilled health staff correlated significantly with immunisation coverage across many world regions. Interpretation Our vaccine performance index highlighted countries at risk of failing to achieve the GVAP target of 90\% coverage by 2015, and could aid policy makers' assessments of the strength and resilience of immunisation programmes. Weakening correlations with socioeconomic factors show a need to tackle vaccine confidence, whereas strengthening correlations point to clear factors to address.

We used a Bayesian multinomial logit Gaussian process model to produce estimates of public perceptions towards the safety, importance, and effectiveness of vaccines. Associations between vaccine uptake and a large range of putative drivers of uptake, including vaccine confidence, socioeconomic status, and sources of trust, were determined using univariate Bayesian logistic regressions.

We find signs that confidence has improved between 2018 and 2019 in some EU member states, including Finland, France, Ireland, and Italy, with recent losses detected in Poland. Confidence in the importance of vaccines (rather than in their safety or effectiveness) had the strongest univariate association with vaccine uptake compared with other determinants considered.

By November 30, 2020, when this paper was written, 13.5 million cases were reported in the U.S. with over 268 000 deaths. Historically, vaccines have been one of the most effective and efficient technical tools for controlling a communicable disease. While the development of these vaccines has certainly been a challenge, it could be more challenging to achieve robust vaccine uptake because of many barriers. In this review, we focused on two types of barriers documented from long-term experience in the U.S.: structural and attitudinal. Structural barriers are systemic issues that impact one's ability to access a service, and they include time, transportation, cost, and clinic or outlet location; while attitudinal barriers are beliefs or perceptions that impact the willingness of at-risk individuals to seek out and/or accept a service. In the context of vaccination they include beliefs about the communicable disease, beliefs about vaccines, fear, and trust in healthcare and governmental agencies. Of the attitudinal barriers, public trust is a barrier that is of particular importance. In addition to affecting reception of vaccines, it may exacerbate disparities and reduce the likelihood of success of a vaccination program. Recommendations are made to overcome attitudinal barriers to help improve the effectiveness of vaccination programs for COVID-19 control in the U.S., such as building public support through bipartisan endorsements and leveraging social media platforms to promote vaccination.},

  abstract = {Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees, and gradient boosted trees are popular non-linear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here, we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions: 1) The first polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. 2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. 3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to i) identify high magnitude but low frequency non-linear mortality risk factors in the US population, ii) highlight distinct population sub-groups with shared risk characteristics, iii) identify non-linear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease, and iv) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains., Exact game-theoretic explanations for ensemble tree-based predictions that guarantee desirable properties.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Importance: The United States is in a race against time to vaccinate its population to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. With limited resources, a proactive, targeted effort is needed to reach widespread community immunity. Objective: Identify county-level barriers to achieving rapid COVID-19 vaccine coverage and validate the index against vaccine rollout data. Design: Ecological study Setting: Population-based Participants: Longitudinal COVID-19 vaccination coverage data for 50 states and the District of Columbia and 3118 counties from January 12 through May 25, 2021. Exposure(s): The COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage index (CVAC) ranks states and counties on barriers to coverage through 28 indicators across 5 themes: historic undervaccination, sociodemographic barriers, resource-constrained health system, healthcare accessibility barriers, and irregular care-seeking behaviors. A score of 0 indicates the lowest level of concern, whereas a score of 1 indicates the highest level of concern. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): State-level vaccine administrations from January 12 through May 25, 2021, provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Our World In Data. County-level vaccine coverage as of May 25, 2021, provided by the CDC. Results: As of May 25, 2021, the CVAC strongly correlated with the percentage of population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by county (r = -0.39, p=2.2x10-16) and state (r=-0.77, p=4.9x10-11). Low-concern states and counties have fully vaccinated 26.5\% [t=6.8, p=1.7x10-7] and 26\% (t=22.0, p=2.2x10-16) more people, respectively, compared to their high-concern counterparts. This vaccination gap is at its highest point since the start of vaccination and continues to grow. Higher concern on each of the five themes predicts a lower rate of vaccination at the county level (all p\&lt;.001). We identify five types of counties with distinct barrier profiles. Conclusions and Relevance: The CVAC measures underlying barriers to vaccination and is strongly associated with the speed of rollout. As the coverage gap between high- and low-concern regions continues to grow, the CVAC can inform a precision public health response targeted to underlying barriers.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Feature selection can improve the accuracy of machine-learning models, but appropriate steps must be taken to avoid overfitting. Nested cross-validation (nCV) is a common approach that chooses the classification model and features to represent a given outer fold based on features that give the maximum inner-fold accuracy. Differential privacy is a related technique to avoid overfitting that uses a privacy-preserving noise mechanism to identify features that are stable between training and holdout sets.We develop consensus nested cross-validation (cnCV) that combines the idea of feature stability from differential privacy with nCV. Feature selection is applied in each inner fold and the consensus of top features across folds is used as a measure of feature stability or reliability instead of classification accuracy, which is used in standard nCV. We use simulated data with main effects, correlation and interactions to compare the classification accuracy and feature selection performance of the new cnCV with standard nCV, Elastic Net optimized by cross-validation, differential privacy and private evaporative cooling (pEC). We also compare these methods using real RNA-seq data from a study of major depressive disorder.The cnCV method has similar training and validation accuracy to nCV, but cnCV has much shorter run times because it does not construct classifiers in the inner folds. The cnCV method chooses a more parsimonious set of features with fewer false positives than nCV. The cnCV method has similar accuracy to pEC and cnCV selects stable features between folds without the need to specify a privacy threshold. We show that cnCV is an effective and efficient approach for combining feature selection with classification.Code available at https://github.com/insilico/cncv.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

While numbers of deaths can be used to estimate actual number of infections after a time lag, counties with low death counts early on have considerable uncertainty about true numbers of cases in the future. Here we show that supplementing county-scale mortality statistics with socioeconomic data helps estimate true numbers of COVID-19 infections in low-data counties, and hence provide an early warning of future concern. We fit a LASSO negative binomial regression to select a parsimonious set of five predictive variables from thirty-one county-level covariates. Of these, population density, public transportation use, voting patterns and \% African-American population are most predictive of higher COVID-19 death rates. To test the model, we show that counties identified as under-estimating COVID-19 on an early date (April 17) have relatively higher deaths later (July 1) in the pandemic.},

In the United States, allocation frameworks are determined by each of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 64 jurisdictions (50 states, the District of Columbia, five cities and eight territories). In this study, we analyzed vaccine allocation plans published by 8 November 2020, tracking updates through to 30 March 2021. We evaluated whether jurisdictions adopted proposals to reduce inequity using disadvantage indices and related place-based measures. By 30 March 2021, 14 jurisdictions had prioritized specific zip codes in combination with metrics such as COVID-19 incidence, and 37 jurisdictions (including 34 states) had adopted disadvantage indices, compared to 19 jurisdictions in November 2020. Uptake of indices doubled from 7 to 14 among the jurisdictions with the largest shares of disadvantaged communities. Five applications were distinguished: (1) prioritizing disadvantaged groups through increased shares of vaccines or vaccination appointments; (2) defining priority groups or areas; (3) tailoring outreach and communication; (4) planning the location of dispensing sites; and (5) monitoring receipt. To ensure that equity features centrally in allocation plans, policymakers at the federal, state and local levels should universalize the uptake of disadvantage indices and related place-based measures.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Importance: Federal and state governments sought to prioritize vulnerable communities in the vaccine rollout through various methods of prioritization, and it is necessary to understand whether inequities exist. Objective: To assess whether vulnerable counties have achieved similar rates of coverage to non-vulnerable areas, and how vaccine acceptance varies by vulnerability. Design, Setting, and Participants: We use population-weighted univariate linear regressions to associate the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) and its 7 constituent themes with a county-level time series of vaccine coverage and vaccine acceptance. We fit a multilevel model to understand how vulnerability within and across states associates with coverage as of May 8, 2021. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index was used as a metric for county-level vulnerability. County-level daily COVID-19 vaccination data on both first doses administered and people fully vaccinated from April 3, 2021 through May 8, 2021 were extracted from the Covid Act Now API. County-level daily COVID-19 vaccine acceptance survey data from January 6, 2021 through May 4, 2021 were obtained via the Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Group COVIDcast API. Results: Vulnerable counties have consistently lagged less vulnerable counties. As of May 8, the top third of vulnerable counties in the US had fully vaccinated 11.3\% fewer people than the bottom third (30.7\% vs 34.6\% of adult population; linear regression, p= 2.2e-16), and 12.1\% fewer initiated vaccinations (40.1\% vs 45.6\%; linear regression, p= 2.2e-16)). Six out of seven dimensions of vulnerability, including Healthcare System Factors and Socioeconomic Status, predicted lower coverage whereas the Population Density theme associated with higher coverage. Vulnerable counties have also consistently had a slightly lower level of vaccine acceptance, though as of May 4, 2021 this difference was observed to be only 0.7\% between low- and high-vulnerability counties (high: 86.1\%, low: 85.5\%, p=0.027). Conclusions and Relevance: The vaccination gap between vulnerable and non-vulnerable counties is substantial and not readily explained by a difference in acceptance. Vulnerable populations continue to need additional support, and targeted interventions are necessary to achieve similar coverage in vulnerable counties compared to those less vulnerable to COVID-19.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A systematic review and thematic analysis of 28 studies on the Influenza A/H1N1 pandemic and the global spread of Ebola Virus Disease. We found seven major factors that promote vaccine hesitancy or acceptance: demographic factors influencing vaccination (ethnicity, age, sex, pregnancy, education, and employment), accessibility and cost, personal responsibility and risk perceptions, precautionary measures taken based on the decision to vaccinate, trust in health authorities and vaccines, the safety and efficacy of a new vaccine, and lack of information or vaccine misinformation. An understanding of participant experiences and perspectives toward vaccines from previous pandemics will greatly inform the development of strategies to address the present situation with the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss the impact vaccine hesitancy might have for the introduction and effectiveness of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. In particular, we believe that skepticism toward vaccines can still exist when there are no vaccines available, which is contrary to contemporary conceptualizations of vaccine hesitancy.
